    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will describe necessary steps for completing given task. in order to address current use case of comparing **two legal documents** (Apple Music's Terms and Conditions for year 2015 and 2023), we have decided to implement a **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** solution. We walk through RAG using the new gpt-index library called now LlamaIndex. This new library will help to mitigate response failure, and provide a comprehensive pipelines for RAG implementation.\n",
    "In this document, we will outline the 5 stages for implementing this RAG pipeline described as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "             Loading--> Indexing --> Storing --> Querying --> Evaluation \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loading involves fetching data from different sources and integrating it into your pipeline using LlamaHub connectors (ideal for csv, pdf, api,google docs files), however as current version of LLamainex 0.9.4 did not allow us to load .docx, we have transformed current given word documents to pdf extension.\n",
    "2. Indexing creates structured representations, including vector embeddings and metadata, for efficient data retrieval in LLMs.\n",
    "3. Storing the indexed data and metadata prevents the need for re-indexing, Llamaindex have its own vector database but in production we can use Pinecone.\n",
    "4. Querying involves using LLMs and LlamaIndex data structures for various query strategies. we will test a **basic** query engine and a **sub-questions-query** engine.\n",
    "5. Evaluation measures the pipeline's effectiveness, offering objective metrics for response accuracy, faithfulness, and speed. we will compare the two strategies.\n",

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION To avoid muscle, joint, or eye strain during your use of the products offered through the Stores, you should always take frequent breaks, and take a longer rest if you experience any soreness, fatigue, or discomfort. A very small percentage of people may experience seizures or blackouts when exposed to flashing lights or patterns, including but not limited to while playing video games or watching videos. Symptoms may include dizziness, nausea, involuntary movements, loss of awareness, altered vision, tingling, numbness, or other discomforts. Consult a doctor before using the products offered through the Stores if you have ever suffered these or similar symptoms, and stop using such products immediately and see a doctor if they occur during your use of such products. Parents should monitor their children’s use of the products offered through the Stores for signs of symptoms. PRE-ORDERS By pre-ordering products, you are authorizing the Stores to automatically charge your account and, if you have enabled automatic downloads, download the product when it becomes available. You may cancel your pre-order anytime prior to the time the item becomes available and as set out in our refund policy above. FAMILY SHARING Family Sharing allows you to share eligible iTunes, App Store, Mac App Store, and iBooks Store products with up to six members (including yourself) of a “Family.” If you set up or join a Family, you may view the eligible products of other Family members and download such products to your compatible device or computer. You can also choose to hide purchases so that other Family members will not be able to view or download them from you. You can share information such as photos and videos via the Photo app, events via your Family Calendar, reminders via the Reminders app, location information via Find My Friends, and device location via Find My iPhone. Family Sharing is for personal, non-commercial use only. iTunes and iCloud accounts are required; iOS 8 and/or OS X Yosemite are required to start and join a Family. Certain transactions and features may not be compatible with earlier software and may require a software upgrade. If you join a Family, the features of Family Sharing are enabled on your compatible devices and computers automatically. The “Organiser” of a Family can invite other members to participate in the Family. The Organiser must be 18 years or older and must have an eligible payment method registered with iTunes. If you are an Organiser, you represent that you are the parent or legal guardian of any Family member under age 13. The Organiser's payment method is used to pay for any purchase initiated by a Family member in excess of any store credit in such initiating Family member’s account. Family members are acting as agents for the Organiser when the Organiser's payment method is used. Products are associated with the account of the Family member who initiated the transaction. BY INVITING FAMILY MEMBERS TO JOIN A FAMILY, THE ORGANISER AGREES THAT ALL CHARGES FOR PURCHASES INITIATED BY FAMILY MEMBERS ARE AUTHORISED BY AND ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ORGANISER, EVEN IF THE ORGANISER WAS UNAWARE OF ANY PARTICULAR TRANSACTION, IF A FAMILY MEMBER EXCEEDED HIS OR HER AUTHORITY AS GRANTED BY THE ORGANISER, OR IF MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS INITIATE PURCHASES FOR THE SAME PRODUCT.

The Organiser can change the payment method on file at any time. A record of the purchase will be sent to the initiating Family member and the Organiser, even if the purchase is hidden by the Family member; please use Report a Problem on your receipt if you or your Family members do not recognise charges on your receipt or payment method statement. The Organiser can use the Ask to Buy function to require children under the age of 18 to obtain permission from the Organiser, and/or other adults designated by the Organiser, to download free or paid products before a purchase or download commences. Products downloaded from Family members and products acquired via redemption codes are not subject to Ask to Buy. If you are an Organiser, you represent that you and/or any adult designee is the parent or legal guardian of any Family member for whom Ask to Buy is activated. Ask to Buy is optimized for iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite; product purchase or download requests from earlier software may present users with an alternative permission process or prevent purchases altogether, and may require a software upgrade. iTunes is not responsible for any harm resulting from a delay in Ask to Buy approvals or denials. The Organiser may remove any Family member from the Family, which will terminate that Family member's ability to initiate authorised purchases on the Organiser's payment method, and that Family Member’s ability to view and share other Family members' products and information. When a Family member leaves or is removed from a Family, or the Organiser's Apple ID is terminated for any reason, the remaining Family members may no longer be able to view or download the departing member’s products or information, or access products previously downloaded from the departing Family member, including purchases made on the Organiser's payment method while the departing member was part of the Family. Similarly, if you leave a Family, you may no longer be able to view or download the products or information of the other Family members, and products that you downloaded from other Family members while a member of the Family may no longer be accessible. If you have made In-App Purchases from an app originally purchased by a departed Family member or downloaded from a Family member and you no longer belong to the Family, you need to purchase the app yourself and restore the In-App Purchases to regain access to them; please review the developer’s policies and the section of this Agreement entitled “In-App Purchases” before buying In-App Purchases. Because personal accounts for users under age 13 can only be created as part of Family Sharing, deleting such an account in order to remove it from the Family will terminate that Family member’s Apple ID and his or her ability to access any Apple services that require an Apple ID or any content associated with that Apple ID. You can only belong to one Family at a time, and may join any Family no more than twice per year. You can change the store account you associate with a Family no more than once every 90 days. All Family members must use the same iTunes Store country or region. Music, movies, TV shows and books can be downloaded from the iTunes Store on up to 10 devices per account, only five of which can be computers; eligible apps can be downloaded to any devices the Family member owns or controls. Not all products, including In-App Purchases, content that is not available for re-download, subscriptions, and some previously purchased apps, are eligible for Family Sharing. Apple reserves the right to disband a Family in accordance with the “Termination” section of this Agreement. ELECTRONIC CONTRACTING Your use of the Stores includes the ability to enter into agreements and/or to make transactions electronically. You acknowledge that your electronic submissions constitute your agreement and intent to be bound by and to pay for such agreements and transactions. Your agreement and intent to be bound by electronic submissions applies to all records relating to all transactions you enter into on this site, including notices of cancellation, policies, contracts and applications.

B. ITUNES STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THIS LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND ITUNES SARL. (\"ITUNES\") GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE ITUNES STORE SERVICE (THE “SERVICE”). THE ITUNES STORE SERVICE iTunes is the provider of the Service, which permits you to access, purchase or rent a licence for digital content (\"iTunes Products\") for end user use only under the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. iTunes is not the provider of the iTunes application or of the iPad, iPod or iPhone. REQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF THE SERVICE Only persons aged 13 years or older can create accounts. Accounts for persons under 13 years old can be created by a parent or legal guardian using Family Sharing. Children under the age of 18 should review this Agreement with their parent or legal guardian to ensure that the child and parent or legal guardian understand it. The Service is available to you only in the United Kingdom. You agree not to use or attempt to use the Service from outside this location. iTunes may use technologies to verify your compliance. Use of the Service requires compatible devices, Internet access, and certain software (fees may apply); may require periodic updates; and may be affected by the performance of these factors. High-speed Internet access is strongly recommended for regular use and is required for Film Rentals. The latest version of the iTunes software is recommended to access the Service and may be required for certain transactions or features and to download iTunes Products previously purchased or acquired from the Service. You agree that meeting these requirements, which may change from time to time, is your responsibility. The Service is not part of any other product or offering, and no purchase or obtaining of any other product shall be construed to represent or guarantee you access to the Service. YOUR ACCOUNT As a registered user of the Service, you may establish an account (\"Account\"). Don’t reveal your Account information to anyone else. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account and for all activities that occur on or through your Account, and you agree to immediately notify iTunes of any security breach of your Account. iTunes shall not be responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorised use of your Account. In order to purchase and download iTunes Products from the Service, you must enter your Apple ID and password or use Touch ID to authenticate your Account for transactions. Once you have authenticated your Account using your Apple ID and password, you will not need to authenticate again for fifteen minutes on your computer or iOS Device; you can choose to allow your computer or Apple TV to remember your password to remain authenticated. During this time, you will be able to purchase and download iTunes Products without re-entering your password. You can turn off the ability to make iTunes Product transactions or change settings to require a password for every transaction by adjusting the settings on your computer, iOS Device, or Apple TV. For more information, please see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1904 and http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213.

AUTOMATIC DELIVERY AND DOWNLOADING PREVIOUS PURCHASES When you first acquire music, purchased (i.e. not rented) movie, TV show and music video iTunes Products (collectively, “iTunes Eligible Content”), you may elect to automatically receive (“auto-download”) copies of such iTunes Eligible Content on additional compatible iOS Devices (except for purchased movies and TV show iTunes Products) and iTunes-authorized computers with compatible software by associating such iOS Devices and computers subject to the association rules below (each, an “Associated Device”). For each Associated Device, you may specify which type of iTunes Eligible Content, if any, may be auto-downloaded to it. On an Associated Device that is capable of receiving push notifications (“Push-Enabled”), including iOS Devices, the iTunes Eligible Content will auto-download to that Associated Device when it has an Internet connection; on an Associated Device that is not Push-Enabled, iTunes Eligible Content will automatically appear in the download queue and you may manually initiate the download within iTunes. As an accommodation to you, subsequent to acquiring iTunes Eligible Content, you may download certain of such previously-acquired iTunes Eligible Content onto any Associated Device. Some iTunes Eligible Content that you previously acquired may not be available for subsequent download at any given time, and iTunes shall have no liability to you in such event. As you may not be able to subsequently download certain previously-acquired iTunes Eligible Content, once you download an item of iTunes Eligible Content, it is your responsibility not to lose, destroy, or damage it, and you may want to back it up. Association of Associated Devices is subject to the following terms: (i) You may auto-download iTunes Eligible Content or download previously-acquired iTunes Eligible Content from an Account on up to 10 Associated Devices, provided no more than 5 are iTunes-authorized computers. (ii) An Associated Device can be associated with only one Account at any given time. (iii) You may switch an Associated Device to a different Account only once every 90 days. (iv) You may download previously-acquired free content onto an unlimited number of devices while it is free on the iTunes Service, but on no more than 5 iTunes-authorized computers. An Apple TV is not an “Associated Device.” However, TV show iTunes Products and purchased (i.e. not rented) movies iTunes Products may be played back on compatible Apple TVs, provided that you may only play back any such TV show or movie on a limited number of Apple TVs at the same time. Some pieces of iTunes Eligible Content may be large, and significant data charges may result from delivery of such iTunes Eligible Content over a data connection. ITUNES MATCH iTunes Match permits you to remotely access your matched or uploaded songs, and music videos you have purchased with your Account, along with related metadata, playlists, and other information about your iTunes Library (“iTunes Match Content”). You may subscribe to iTunes Match for an annual fee. You must have a valid credit card on file with iTunes to subscribe. The subscription is non-refundable (except as required by applicable law or as set out in our refund policy above), and will automatically renew for one-year periods until you cancel. Your account will be charged no more than 24 hours prior to the expiration of the current subscription period.

FURTHER MAC APP STORE AND APP STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS LICENSE OF MAC APP STORE AND APP STORE PRODUCTS iTunes is selling you a licence to use the software products made available through the Mac App Store and App Store (collectively, the “App Store Products”). There are two (2) categories of App Store Products, as follows: (i) those App Store Products that have been developed by Apple, and which are licensed to you by iTunes (“Apple Products”); and (ii) those App Store Products that have been developed, and are licensed to you, by a third-party developer (“Third-Party Products”). The category of a particular App Store Product (Apple Product or Third-Party Product) is identified on the Mac App Store Application or App Store application. Your license to each App Store Product is subject to the Licensed Application End User License Agreement set forth below, and you agree that such terms will apply unless the App Store Product is covered by a valid end user license agreement entered into between you and the publisher of that App Store Product (the “Publisher”), in which case the Publisher’s end user license agreement will apply to that App Store Product. The Publisher reserves all rights in and to the App Store Product not expressly granted to you. You acknowledge that the license to each Apple Product that you obtain through the Mac App Store or App Store, or you associate with your Account, is a binding agreement between you and iTunes. You acknowledge that: once you acquire a Third-Party Product from iTunes, you are entering into a binding agreement directly with the Publisher of that Third-Party Product governing your use of that Third-Party Product; and iTunes is not a party to the license between you and the Publisher with respect to that Third-Party Product.

You acknowledge and agree that iTunes and its affiliates are third-party beneficiaries of the Licensed Application End User License Agreement or the Publisher’s end user license agreement, as the case may be, for each Third-Party Product. You also agree that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the license to any such Third-Party Product, iTunes will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce such license against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof. IN-APP PURCHASES Certain App Store Products may include functionality that enables you to receive additional services, or licenses to additional functionality or content for use within the App Store Product (\"In App Purchases\"). In App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App Store Product (for example, virtual ammunition) cannot be transferred among devices; can be downloaded only once; and after being downloaded, cannot be replaced. Once a consumable In App Purchase is acquired and received by you, iTunes shall be without liability to you in the event of any loss, destruction, or damage. All In-App Purchases are deemed App Store Products, and In App Purchases received within Third-Party Products are deemed Third-Party Products, and treated as such, for purposes of these terms and conditions. You must authenticate to acquire In-App Purchases separately from any authentication to obtain App Store Products by entering your password when prompted, but once you have authenticated to obtain an In-App Purchase, you will be able to acquire additional In-App Purchases for fifteen minutes without re-entering your password. You can turn off the ability to acquire In-App Purchases on your iOS Device by going to your Settings, selecting “General” and then selecting the “Restrictions” tab, as outlined at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213. IN-APP SUBSCRIPTIONS Certain App Store Products may include functionality that enables you to acquire content on a subscription basis (“In-App Subscriptions”). In-App Subscriptions will automatically renew for the applicable time period you have selected and, where applicable, your Account will be charged no more than 24-hours prior to the expiration of the current In-App Subscription period. You may cancel automatic renewal of paid In-App Subscriptions by selecting Manage App Subscriptions in your Account and selecting the subscription you want to modify. The auto-renew feature of the subscription will be turned off if the Publisher increases the price of the subscription. You may cancel free In-App Subscriptions by deleting the App Store Product from your device. Certain paid In-App Subscriptions may offer a free trial period prior to charging your Account. If you decide you do not want to purchase the In App Subscription, turn off auto-renewal in your Account settings during the free trial period. Certain In-App Subscriptions may be designated as “Newsstand” products, in which case they will appear only within the Newsstand application on your device after download. You should also review additional information about the paid In-App Subscription offer at the point of sale within the App Store Product. We may ask for your permission to provide the name, email address and postcode listed in your Account to the Publisher so that the Publisher can send you marketing messages about its own products in accordance with its privacy policy. Once the Publisher has this information, it will be treated in accordance with the Publisher\\'s publicly posted privacy policy. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of the Publisher before agreeing to give it your personal information. For more information, please review the Publisher\\'s privacy policy or contact the Publisher directly. Refunds are available as set out in our refund policy above; no other refunds, returns or cancellations after purchase.

By creating an account for use of the Services in a particular country or territory you are specifying it as your Home Country.

Our Services’ performance may be affected by these factors. B. USING OUR SERVICES PAYMENTS, TAXES AND REFUNDS You can acquire Content on our Services for free or for a charge, either of which is referred to as a “Transaction”. By each Transaction, you acquire a license to use the Content only. Each Transaction is an electronic contract between you and Apple and/or you and the entity providing the Content on our Services.

This may result in a change to the start of your next Paid Subscription period and may change the date on which you are billed for each period, as displayed on your receipt.

D. FAMILY SHARING The organizer of a Family (“Organizer”) must be 18 years (or the equivalent age of majority in your Home Country) or older and the parent or legal guardian of any Family member under age 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in their Home Country as set forth in the registration process). Apple devices are required for access to all of the Family Sharing features. Family Sharing allows eligible subscriptions to be shared among up to six members of a Family. To learn more about Family Sharing visit: https://support.apple.com/HT201060. Purchase Sharing: Family Sharing’s Purchase Sharing feature allows eligible Content to be shared among up to six members of a Family. The Organizer invites other members to participate, and agrees to pay for all Transactions initiated by Family members. The Organizer's eligible payment methods are used to pay for any Transaction initiated by a Family member (except when the Family member’s account has store credit, which is always used first). Family members are acting as agents for the Organizer when the Organizer’s eligible payment methods are used. The Organizer hereby agrees (1) to pay for such Transactions; (2) that Transactions initiated by Family members are authorized; and (3) Transactions will be charged to eligible payment methods in the manner indicated in Section B above. Organizers are responsible for complying with their payment method contracts, and assume all risk related to sharing access to their eligible payment methods with Family members. A receipt or invoice for any Family member Transaction is sent to the initiating Family member and, if billed to the Organizer’s payment method, also to the Organizer. Ask to Buy: Ask to Buy is a feature that allows an Organizer to approve Transactions initiated by a Family member under age 18 (or the equivalent age of majority in your Home Country). Content shared by Family members or acquired via content codes generally is not subject to Ask to Buy; content codes facilitating access to subscriptions are subject to Ask to Buy. The Organizer must be the parent or legal guardian of any Family member for whom Ask to Buy is activated. Ask to Buy is enabled by default for any Family member under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in their Home Country) and stays on until deactivated by the parent or legal guardian. If Ask to Buy is turned off after the Family member turns 18 years old, it cannot be turned on anymore. Ask to Buy does not require Purchase Sharing to be enabled. \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Apple TV+, Apple TV Channels, Apple One Family, Apple One Premier, Apple Music Family, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, and Apple Fitness+ subscriptions are automatically enabled for Family Sharing. Subscriptions shared by a Family may be subject to Content usage limitations on a per subscription basis. E. SERIES PASS AND MULTI-PASS A Pass allows you to purchase and receive television Content as it becomes available. A Series Pass applies to television Content that has a limited number of episodes per series; a Multi-Pass applies to television Content that is available on an ongoing basis. The full price of a Series Pass or Multi-Pass is charged at the time of the Transaction. Series Pass or Multi-Pass Content is available for download up to 90 days after the last episode becomes available. If a Content provider delivers to Apple fewer TV episodes than planned when you purchased a Series Pass, we will credit to your Apple ID the retail value of the corresponding number of episodes that were not provided to Apple. F. ADDITIONAL APP STORE TERMS (EXCLUDING APPLE ARCADE APPS) LICENSE OF APP STORE CONTENT App licenses are provided to you by Apple or a third party developer (“App Provider”). Apple acts as an agent for App Providers in operating the App Store and is not a party to the sales contract or user agreement between you and the App Provider. However, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., the merchant of record is Apple Distribution International Ltd., which means that you acquire the App license from Apple Distribution International Ltd., but the App is licensed by the App Provider. An App licensed by Apple is an “Apple App”; an App licensed by an App Provider is a “Third Party App\". Any App that you acquire is governed by the Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”) set forth below, unless Apple or the App Provider provides an overriding custom license agreement (“Custom EULA”). The App Provider of any Third Party App is solely responsible for its content, warranties, and claims that you may have related to the Third Party App, subject to local law. You acknowledge and agree that Apple is a third-party beneficiary of the Standard EULA or Custom EULA applicable to each Third Party App and may therefore enforce such agreement.

In-App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App (for example, virtual gems) cannot be transferred among devices and can be downloaded only once. You must authenticate your account before making In-App Purchases – separate from any authentication to obtain other Content – by entering your password or using Touch ID or Face ID. You will be able to make additional In-App Purchases for fifteen minutes without re-authenticating unless you have asked us to require a password for every purchase or have enabled Touch ID or Face ID. You can turn off the ability to make In-App Purchases by following these instructions: https://support.apple.com/HT201304. APP MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT Apple is responsible for providing maintenance and support for Apple Apps only, or as required under applicable law. App Providers are responsible for providing maintenance and support for Third Party Apps. APP BUNDLES Some Apps may be sold together as a bundle (“App Bundle”). The price displayed with an App Bundle is the price you will be charged upon purchasing the App Bundle. The App Bundle price may be reduced to account for Apps you have already purchased or acquired, but may include a minimum charge to complete the App Bundle. SEARCH RESULTS AND RANKINGS When determining how to order the Apps in search results, the main parameters considered are the metadata provided by App Providers, how customers have engaged with the Apps and the App Store, and the popularity of the Apps in the App Store. These main parameters deliver the most relevant results to customer search queries. LICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT Apps made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you. Your license to each App is subject to your prior acceptance of either this Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”), or a custom end user license agreement between you and the App Provider (“Custom EULA”), if one is provided.

H. ADDITIONAL APPLE MUSIC TERMS iCloud Music Library is an Apple Music feature that allows you to access your matched or uploaded songs, playlists and music videos acquired from Apple Music, the iTunes Store or another source (“iCloud Music Library Content”) on your Apple Music-enabled devices. iCloud Music Library is turned on automatically when you set up your Apple Music membership. iCloud Music Library collects information about your iCloud Music Library Content. This information is associated with your Apple ID, and compared to iCloud Music Library Content currently available on Apple Music. iCloud Music Library Content that is not matched is uploaded to Apple’s iCloud Music Library servers (in a format determined by Apple). You can upload up to 100,000 songs. Songs acquired from the iTunes Store do not count against this limit. Songs that do not meet certain criteria (for example, excessively large files) or that are not authorized for your device are not eligible for iCloud Music Library. When you use iCloud Music Library, Apple logs information such as the tracks you play, stop or skip, the devices you use and the time and duration of playback. You agree to use iCloud Music Library only for lawfully acquired content. iCloud Music Library is provided on an “AS IS” basis and could contain errors or inaccuracies. You should back up your data and information prior to using iCloud Music Library. If you are not an Apple Music member, you may purchase an iTunes Match subscription, which uses iCloud Music Library. When your Apple Music membership ends, you will lose access to your iCloud Music Library, including iCloud Music Library Content that is uploaded to iCloud Music Library servers. I.

If you purchase a Carrier Membership, your carrier is the merchant of record, which means that you acquire the Service license from your carrier, which will bill you for the cost of your Service membership, but the Service is licensed and provided by Apple. Your purchase relationship with the carrier is governed by the carrier’s terms and conditions, not this Agreement, and any billing disputes related to a Carrier Membership must be directed to your carrier, not Apple.

TO AGREE TO THESE TERMS, CLICK \"AGREE.\" IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT CLICK \"AGREE,\" AND DO NOT USE THE ITUNES STORE, MAC APP STORE, APP STORE OR IBOOKS STORE. THIS AGREEMENT APPLIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO SOFTWARE LICENCES THAT YOU MAY HAVE ENTERED INTO, SUCH AS FOR THE USE OF THE ITUNES APPLICATION. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PLEASE VISIT http://www.apple.com/support/. A. ITUNES STORE, MAC APP STORE, APP STORE AND IBOOKS STORE TERMS OF SALE PAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUND POLICY You agree that you will pay for all products you purchase through the Stores, and that iTunes may charge your payment method for any products purchased and for any additional amounts (including any taxes and late fees, as applicable) that may be accrued by or in connection with your Account. You are responsible for the timely payment of all fees and for providing iTunes with a valid payment method for payment of all fees. For details of how purchases are billed please visit http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5582. You agree to receipt of all invoices in an electronic format, which may include email. Your total price will include the price of the product plus any applicable VAT (in effect on the day of download). By using the United Kingdom store you are specifying that as your country of residence for tax purposes. Right of cancellation: If you choose to cancel your order, you may do so within 14 days from when you received your receipt without giving any reason, except iTunes Gifts which cannot be refunded once you have redeemed the code. To cancel your order, you must inform us of your decision. To ensure immediate processing we recommend you use Report a Problem to cancel all items with the exception of iTunes Match, Season Pass, Multi-Pass and, unless purchased from a third party or redeemed, iTunes Gifts and Allowances, which can be cancelled by contacting iTunes Support. You also have the right to inform us using the model cancellation form below or by making any other clear statement. If you use Report a Problem we will communicate acknowledgement of receipt of your cancellation to you without delay. To meet the cancellation deadline, you must send your communication of cancellation before the 14-day period has expired. Effects of cancellation: We will reimburse you no later than 14 days from the day on which we receive your cancellation notice. We will use the same means of payment as you used for the transaction, and you will not incur any fees for such reimbursement. Exception to the right of cancellation: You cannot cancel your order for the supply of digital content if the delivery has started upon your request and acknowledgement that you thereby lose your cancellation right. </pre>"

If a product becomes unavailable following a transaction but prior to download, your sole remedy is likely to be limited to a refund of the price paid for the unavailable product. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of your product, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement or refund of the price paid, as determined by iTunes. 1-Click® 1-Click is a registered service mark of Amazon.com, Inc., used under license. 1-Click is a convenient feature that allows you to make a purchase from the Stores with a single click of your mouse or other input device. When accessing the Stores on your computer, 1-Click purchasing may be activated via the dialog that appears when you click a Buy button. (You may reset this selection at any time by clicking Reset Warnings in your Account information). When accessing the Stores on your Apple-branded products running iOS such as an iPad, iPod touch, or iPhone (“iOS Device”), 1-Click is activated for each transaction by tapping the button showing the price of the product, which reveals the Buy button. When 1-Click is activated, clicking or tapping the Buy button starts the download immediately and completes your transaction without any further steps. GIFT CERTIFICATES, ITUNES CARDS AND CODES, ALLOWANCES, AND CONTENT CODES Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards and Codes, Content Codes, and Allowances, in addition to unused balances, are not redeemable for cash and, cannot be returned for a cash refund (except as set out in our refund policy above that is applicable in the event the item has been purchased from the iTunes Store; or except if the retailer from which the item has been purchased applies a different refund policy), without prejudice to any applicable statutory right to a refund in case of faulty or misdescribed gifts; exchanged; resold; used to purchase Gifts, Gift Certificates, or iTunes Cards or Codes; used to provide Allowances; used for purchases on the Apple Online Store; or used in Apple Retail Stores. Unused balances are not transferable. Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards and Codes, Content Codes, and Allowances purchased in the United Kingdom may be redeemed through the Stores only in the United Kingdom. iTunes is not responsible for lost or stolen Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards and Codes, Content Codes, or Allowances. Risk of loss and title for Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards and Codes, and Allowances that are transmitted electronically pass to the purchaser in the United Kingdom upon electronic transmission. Risk of loss and title for Content Codes that are transmitted electronically pass from iTunes in Luxembourg upon electronic transmission. </pre>"

ITUNES STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THIS LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND ITUNES SARL. (\"ITUNES\") GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE ITUNES STORE SERVICE (THE “SERVICE”). THE ITUNES STORE SERVICE iTunes is the provider of the Service, which permits you to access, purchase or rent a licence for digital content (\"iTunes Products\") for end user use only under the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. iTunes is not the provider of the iTunes application or of the iPad, iPod or iPhone. REQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF THE SERVICE Only persons aged 13 years or older can create accounts. Accounts for persons under 13 years old can be created by a parent or legal guardian using Family Sharing. Children under the age of 18 should review this Agreement with their parent or legal guardian to ensure that the child and parent or legal guardian understand it. The Service is available to you only in the United Kingdom. You agree not to use or attempt to use the Service from outside this location. iTunes may use technologies to verify your compliance. Use of the Service requires compatible devices, Internet access, and certain software (fees may apply); may require periodic updates; and may be affected by the performance of these factors. High-speed Internet access is strongly recommended for regular use and is required for Film Rentals. The latest version of the iTunes software is recommended to access the Service and may be required for certain transactions or features and to download iTunes Products previously purchased or acquired from the Service. You agree that meeting these requirements, which may change from time to time, is your responsibility. The Service is not part of any other product or offering, and no purchase or obtaining of any other product shall be construed to represent or guarantee you access to the Service.

You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account and for all activities that occur on or through your Account, and you agree to immediately notify iTunes of any security breach of your Account. iTunes shall not be responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorised use of your Account. In order to purchase and download iTunes Products from the Service, you must enter your Apple ID and password or use Touch ID to authenticate your Account for transactions. Once you have authenticated your Account using your Apple ID and password, you will not need to authenticate again for fifteen minutes on your computer or iOS Device; you can choose to allow your computer or Apple TV to remember your password to remain authenticated. During this time, you will be able to purchase and download iTunes Products without re-entering your password. You can turn off the ability to make iTunes Product transactions or change settings to require a password for every transaction by adjusting the settings on your computer, iOS Device, or Apple TV. For more information, please see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1904 and http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213.

In both years, the Terms and Conditions govern the use of Apple's Services and the acquisition of content through the Services. Both versions mention the need for compatible hardware, software, and internet access to use the Services. They also both address the issue of payments, taxes, and refunds for transactions made on the Services.\n",

It sets requirements for the use of the service, such as the minimum age of 13 years for creating accounts and the availability of the service only in the United Kingdom. It also includes provisions regarding the use of gift certificates, iTunes cards and codes, allowances, and content codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, the 2023 Terms and Conditions provide a broader overview of Apple's Services, including the App Store, Apple Arcade, Apple Books, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News, Apple News+, Apple One, Apple Podcasts, Apple Podcasts Subscriptions, Apple TV, Apple TV+, Apple TV Channels, Game Center, and iTunes. It introduces the concept of a Home Country and the requirement to specify it when creating an account. The 2023 version also includes provisions related to carrier account information and miscellaneous terms applicable to all services.\n",
