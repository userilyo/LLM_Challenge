# LLM_Challenge
## This is a repo containing the notebook for task assigned during tech interview with a Lawyer Firm for a LLM Data Scientist.
### Task:
You will be given two versions of publicly available Apple Musicâ€™s Terms & Conditions from different years. Please build a solution to summarise the differences between the two documents, and provide insights for the legal team by completing the following analysis:
1.	A commentary on the nature of the differences to help the legal team understand impact and significance (e.g. substantive meaningful change over form).
2.	Suggestions for standardizing the T&Cs to create a more consistent format.
We would like to see a solution that attempts to leverage LLMs to assist this analysis (irrespective of whether this is in fact the best approach for this task).

## I decided to implement a full RAG lifecyle using LLamaIndex v.0.9.6
